# AI Restaurant Demand Predictor

Building AI course project

## Summary
An AI system that predicts restaurant and hotel food demand using past sales, weather, and seasonal trends. This helps reduce food waste, improve preparation planning, and increase restaurant profit.

## Background
Restaurants frequently face demand uncertainty which leads to:
* Food wastage and financial loss
* Running out of popular dishes
* Poor staff planning

As a hotel operations manager, I personally experience these challenges in daily restaurant operations.

## How is it used?
The system analyzes previous billing data, customer flow, weather, and seasonal patterns to predict next-day demand. Restaurant managers can use this insight to prepare ingredients, manage staff, and avoid shortages.

## Data sources and AI methods
The system can use POS billing data, reservation data, weather forecasts, and seasonal trends. Machine learning methods like regression and time-series prediction can be used.

## Challenges
Prediction accuracy depends on data quality. Unexpected events like sudden weather changes or festivals may affect results.

## What next?
This project can be expanded into a real mobile dashboard for restaurant owners with automated alerts and inventory suggestions.

## Acknowledgments
Inspired by real restaurant operational challenges and the Building AI course.
