AI Restaurant Demand Predictor

Building AI course project

Summary

An AI system that predicts restaurant and hotel food demand using past sales, weather, and seasonal trends. This helps reduce food waste, improve preparation planning, and increase restaurant profit.

Background

Restaurants frequently face demand uncertainty which leads to:

* Food wastage and financial loss
* Running out of popular dishes
* Poor staff planning

As a hotel operations manager, I personally experience these challenges in daily restaurant operations.

How is it used?

The system analyzes previous billing data, customer flow, weather, and seasonal patterns to predict next-day demand.
Managers can prepare inventory, kitchen prep, and staffing accordingly.

Data sources and AI methods

Data sources:

* POS billing history
* Festival and seasonal trends
* Weather data
* Customer visit patterns

AI methods:

* Regression models
* Time-series forecasting
* Machine learning demand prediction

Challenges

* Requires quality historical data
* Sudden events can affect predictions
* Small restaurants may lack digital billing data

What next?

* Mobile prediction dashboard
* Integration with POS software
* Staff scheduling prediction
* Multi-branch demand comparison
